My professional experience is always included as a section in my resume.  If I were to remove that section, the hiring manager to which I would write would be deprived of critical information.  Therefore, as resumes are almost always required, whereas cover letters aren't, I choose to add professional experience to the resume as opposed to the cover letter, in case the cover letter isn't submitted, or worse, ignored.  

I also choose to exclude experience from the cover letter because I don't want to be redundant.  I assume that the hiring manager will expect my resume to contain my job history, and that he or she will find comfort in reading it there.  

The purpose of my cover letter is to make the hiring manager's decision-making process as easy as possible.  I give the hiring manager information about myself by outlining my strengths and weaknesses.  To deprive her of such information would be to knowingly hinder the onboarding process.  

I write my cover letter with the assumption that the hiring manager has concerns about my profile.  For instance, my resume currently outlines a concerning job history.  I changed companies several times within a short period, and I never stayed at each company for an extended duration.  

As such my cover letters carry a more personal tone.  They don't divulge information in exacting terms, with numerous, terse bulleted entries, or confusing dates.  Instead I break my thoughts up in paragraphs, each paragraph representing a block of information about myself.  One of these paragraphs may mention the reasons for my numerous job changes.  Another is reserved for strengths, another for weaknesses, and a solitary sentence may thank the reader for putting valuable time aside in the first place.  

Sam Harris believes that lying is almost completely unnecessary, except in extreme circumstances when you are talking to someone who is not on the same ethical playing-field.  If one finds it necessary to withhold information, then one can.  After all, saying nothing isn't lying.  If lying is like knowingly giving a traveler wrong directions and watching them go, then saying nothing is like telling the traveler to stop the car, knowing the passenger may be confused as to why they are not going anywhere.  In the latter example, the process of reaching the right destination is delayed, but the traveler knows it.  They won't arrive at the wrong destination at a later time, to much frustration, realizing that they have been duped.
