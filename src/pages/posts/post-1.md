Almost every successful person that I follow has conveyed their ideas in writing at some point.  If I want to be like them, then maybe I should write, too.

I am 29 and obsessed with self-optimization.  I didn’t always feel this way.  Most of my life before my mid-twenties was a waste.  

I was a piece-of-shit slacker/alcoholic who did nothing but watch Netflix and play video games.  I drank every day.  I had cut myself many times, with the goal of dying or to relieve suffering.  I had no friends.  I was unproductive and lazy.  I never accomplished anything.  

In 2017 I was 23 years old.  Jordan Peterson and other gurus were starting to gain traction on Youtube, and it was during this time that I started to learn about how successful people live.

Teachers like Sam Harris, Jocko Willink, Gary Vaynerchuk, and Simon Sinek taught me things that neither of my parents had.  Things like how to manage my money and time, and how to optimize my mental and physical health.

This was the point where I realized I was a loser and that I had to turn my life around.  

So I tried various things.  I took up martial arts, running, and meditation.  I quit drinking (or tried).  At first, none of these efforts lasted very long.  I would start something, then quit.  I would stay sober for a few months, then relapse.  

I tried many things, many times.  I failed a lot.  But I always kept trying.  

As of this writing I am 29 years old.  I will be celebrating 1 year of abstinence from alcohol in May.  I am not a loser.  I live a productive life. I am very fit.  I don’t play video games.  I haven’t cut myself in 8 years.

I don’t want to pretend that I have it all figured out today.  There are a lot of things that I still need to work on.  But I have learned a few things that, if shared, could help other people.  

The topics I'll write about might include fitness, mental health, alcoholism, programming, and forex trading.

I don’t want these topics to define the blog going forward, rather, I want you to have a rough idea of the type of content I am interested in publishing.  

Thanks for reading, and I hope that you will find my writing to be helpful.
