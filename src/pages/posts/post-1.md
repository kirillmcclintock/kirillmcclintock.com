Notice:  Certain sections of this post have been redacted, then added back in.  The original publication date was April 1, 2023.  I realized that in an age where internet archiving exists, and in a time of my life where I am trying to live more ethically, that effective redaction is often futile, and that applying my ethical ideas to real-world scenarios is harder than I imagined.  Thus I realized that I should make an effort to minimize such changes in the future, and that is why I have restored this post to a version that closely resembles the original.

Here is the blog post:

Almost every successful person that I follow has conveyed their ideas in writing at some point. If I want to be like them, then maybe I should write, too.

I was a piece-of-shit slacker and alcoholic who did nothing but stream entertainment and play video games. I drank nearly every day. I had cut myself many times, with the goal of dying or to relieve suffering. I had no friends. I was unproductive and lazy. I accomplished very little.

In 2017 I was twenty-three years old. Jordan Peterson and other gurus were starting to gain traction on Youtube, and it was during this time that I started to learn about how successful people live.

Teachers like Sam Harris, Jocko Willink, Gary Vaynerchuk, and Simon Sinek taught me things that I hadn't learned elsewhere. Things like how to manage my money and time, and how to optimize my mental and physical health.

This was the point where I realized I was a loser and that I had to turn my life around.

So I tried various things. I took up martial arts, running, and meditation. I quit drinking (or tried). At first, none of these efforts lasted very long. I would start something, then quit. I would stay sober for a few months, then relapse.

I tried many things, many times. I failed a lot. But I always kept trying.

As of this writing I am twenty-nine years old. I recently passed the date which marks one year of my abstinence from alcohol. Additionally, I haven’t cut myself in eight years.

I don’t want to pretend that I have it all figured out today. There are a lot of things that I still need to work on. But I have learned a few things that, if shared, could help other people.

The topics I’ll write about might include fitness, mental health, alcoholism, programming, and forex trading.

I don’t want these topics to define the blog going forward, rather, I want you to have a rough idea of the type of content I am interested in publishing.

Thanks for reading, and I hope that you will find my writing to be helpful.
