Almost every successful person that I follow has conveyed their ideas in writing at some point.  If I want to be like them, then maybe I should write, too.

The topics I'll write about might include fitness, programming, and forex trading.

I donâ€™t want these topics to define the blog going forward, rather, I want you to have a rough idea of the type of content I am interested in publishing.  

Thanks for reading, and I hope that you will find my writing to be helpful.
